## 1.1 (The Flashlight Problem)
-> The impulse to communicate is one of the most human of traits

Imagine trying to communicate with your friend whose bedroom window at the house neighboring yours faces yours.
* At first you try tracing the letters out with the flashlight, then blinking off after each letter, but the swirls and slashes of light aren’t **precise** enough.
* You settle on trying to flash each letter of the alphabet to them, so that each letter corresponds to a number of on/off flashes that correspond with its position in the alphabet (a=1, z=26)
* but this means it takes 131 blinks of light to communicate something as simple as “how are you?”

### Morse Code
-> In the Flashlight Problem example, Morse code introduces short and long blinks

So it only takes 32 blinks of light to communicate “how are you?”

Instead of talking about short and long blinks in relation to morse code, those blinks of light are referred to as dots and dashes because this allows them to be written/printed.

1. Turning the flashlight on and off quickly = a fast blink = a dot
2. Leave it turned on somewhat longer = a long blink = a dash

* In Morse code, the simpler and shorter codes are assigned to more frequently used letters in the alphabet, like ‘E’ and ’T’.
* Morse code doesn’t differentiate between uppercase and lowercase 
* It can also be used vocally:
* Dot = “dih” (or “dit” for the last dot of a letter)
* Dash = “dah”

#### The Importance of Two
-> Morse code reduces written language to dots and dashes (two types of blinks)
-> Morse code reduces speech to just two vowel sounds (two types of sounds)



**Two different of anything can, with suitable combinations, convey all types of information.**

## 1.2 (The Importance of Understanding Code)
-> Becoming familiar with the nature of code is essential to understanding the hidden languages and inner structures of computer hardware and software

> **Code:** a system for transferring information among people and machines. It lets you communicate. *(This book’s definition)*
* many codes are the basis for human communication
	* English vocabulary can be considered a type of code
	* Speech/the spoken word is another type of code
	* The written word/text – ‘words on paper’ is another type of code
	* Sign languages another type of code dependent on movements and gestures to convey ideas
	* Braille is another type of code dependent on revised bumps to convey ideas

In many languages a strong correspondence exists between speech and text.

**A code is useful if it serves a purpose that no other code can.**

Computers can’t deal directly with human codes because they don’t have the same types of sensory organs as humans and can’t duplicate those experiences.

### Technology for Empowerment
Computer technology has enabled desktop PCs to:
* capture
* store
* manipulate
* render
all types of information used in human communication, including:
* visual (text and pictures)
* aural (spoken words, sounds, and music)
* or a combination of both (animation and movies)

^ Each of these types of information requires a different code.
* in the same way that speech requires one set of human organs (mouth and ears)
* While writing and reading require others (hands and eyes)
