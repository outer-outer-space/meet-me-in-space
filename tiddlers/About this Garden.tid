ðŸŒ± ''This is a static representation of a personal wiki run by [[Sarah Hibner|http://sarah-hibner.com/]]. It has limited functionality (e.g. tags don't work) compared to the local version. ''

This wiki was built using TiddlyWiki and Node JS. It's hosted on GitHub Pages, and uses quite a few modifications, including the following:

* [[Whitespace|http://j.d.whitespace.tiddlyspot.com/]] theme
* [[TiddlyBlink|https://giffmex.org/gifts/tiddlyblink.html#TiddlyBlink%20home]] plugin
* [[Markdown|https://tiddlywiki.com/plugins/tiddlywiki/markdown/]] parser plugin based on [[Remarkable|https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable]] by Jon Schlinkert
* [[Chomsky|https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/chomsky]] web font by Fredrick Brennan

//PS: If you noticed the favicon's working, I know about it. It seems like multiple TiddlyWiki users have had this problem when using GitHub Pages, and there doesn't seem to be a good workaround as of May 2020. The tradeoff's worth it for me.//
