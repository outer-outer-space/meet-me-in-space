## 0.1 (A Book About How Computers Work)
-> A Unique Journey Through the Evolution of the Digital Technologies that Define the Modern Age

Common questions that necessitate knowledge about the inner workings of personal computers:
* What’s the difference between storage and memory?
> Memory is like the surface of your desk and storage is like the filing cabinet.
^ This is an insufficient answer because:
	* Computer architecture isn’t patterned after an office
	* The distinction between memory and storage is artificial, existing only because:
		* We lack a storage medium that’s both fast and vast as well as stable/non-volatile.

von Neumann Architecture is an example of this deficiency.

### Understanding Computers
Computers are constructed in a hierarchy:
	* Information displayed on computer screens is at the top
	* Transistors are down at the bottom

-> This book is structured to describe the aforementioned hierarchy of computers by moving up from the lowest level to the highest.

> Everything in the first 17 chapters of this book can be built entirely using simple electrical devices that have been around for over a century.
