ðŸ“š ''This is where I keep an ongoing set of notes and excerpts about the books I've read or am in the (sometimes years long) process of reading.''

Most of these notes are in various stages of progressive summarization right now. They're liable to change over time as I go back and revise them, or as I re-read these books.
