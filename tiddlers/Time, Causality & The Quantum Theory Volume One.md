## Why did I choose to read this book?
This book and its Volume Two companion were impulse buys from The Last Bookstore in LA within the past year or two. The books caught my eye, as science-related literature does, and I decided to go for it, as I often do with things I don't understand. I'm curious like that. I haven't made it far through this book yet, but I was fascinated by the concept of psychological time, which came up very early on.

## Excerpts
> Accordingly, in addition to time-related findings of relativistic and/or quantal physical theories, the psychological findings concerning time will also be discussed. They are not as conspicuous as the physical findings, and perhaps not as revelatory. But they are by no means negligible and are actually necessary in any comprehensive account of universal time.
> 
> **Psychological theories of time… deal with the subjective (perceptual or memorative) awareness of things temporal, e.g. the relations of simultaneity or succession the length of temporal intervals, and in addition, to the ideas of past, future and ‘specious’ present in the psycho-physical area.**
