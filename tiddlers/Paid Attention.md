!! Why did I choose to read this book?
I was so impressed by [[Faris'|Faris Yakob]] talk at HOW Design Live 2015 that I immediately bought his book after his presentation. I credit this book with sparking my interest in media theory and media philosophy. Years later I still refer back to it regularly.
