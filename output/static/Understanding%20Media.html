Today, after more than a century of electric technology, we have extended our central nervous system itself in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time as far as our planet is concerned. Rapidly, we approach the final phase of the extensions of man— the technological simulation of consciousness, when the creative process of knowing will be collectively and corporately extended to the whole of human society, much as <strong>we have already extended our senses and our nerves by the various media.</strong></p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>In the mechanical age now receding, many actions could be taken without too much concern. Slow movement insured that the reactions were delayed for considerable periods of time. <strong>Today the action and the reaction occur almost at the same time.</strong> We actually live mythically and integrally, as it were, but we continue to think in the old, fragmented space and time patterns of the pre-electric age.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Western man acquired from the technology of literacy the power to act without reacting.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>We acquired the art of carrying out the most dangerous social operations with complete detachment. <strong>But our detachment was a posture of noninvolvement.</strong></p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>In the electric age, when our central nervous system is technologically extended to involve us in the whole of mankind and to  incorporate the whole of mankind in us, we necessarily participate, in depth, in the consequences of our every action.  It is no longer possible to adopt the aloof and dissociated role of the literate Westerner.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Electric speed in bringing all social and political functions together in a sudden implosion has heightened human awareness of responsibility to an intense degree.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>This is the Age of Anxiety for the reason of the electric implosion that compels commitment and participation, quite  regardless of any “point of view.”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The partial and specialized character of the viewpoint, however noble, will not serve at all  in the electric age. At the information level the same upset has occurred with the substitution of the inclusive image for the  mere viewpoint.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The mark of our time is its revulsion against imposed patterns. We are suddenly eager to  have things and people declare their beings totally. There is a deep faith to be found in this new attitude — a faith that concerns the ultimate harmony of all being.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Examination of the origin and development of the individual extensions of man should be preceded by a look at some general aspects of the ::media, or extensions of man::, beginning with the never-explained numbness that each extension brings about in the individual and society.</p></blockquote><p>::all media are extensions of man, but not all extensions of man are media - they are technology?::</p><hr><hr><h2>Introduction to the 2nd Edition</h2><blockquote><p>A story line encompasses a set of events much like a melodic line in music. Melody, the <em>melos modos</em>, “the road round,” is a continuous, connected, and repetitive structure…</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The art and poetry of Zen create involvement by means of the interval, not  by the connection used in the visually organized Western world.  Spectator becomes artist in oriental art because he must  supply all the connections.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Slang offers an immediate index to changing perception. Slang is based not on theories but on immediate experience.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>…any technology gradually creates a totally new human environment. Environments are not passive wrappings but active processes.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>By Plato’s time the written word had created a new environment that had begun to detribalize man.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Previously the  Greeks had grown up by benefit of the process of the tribal  encyclopedia. They had memorized the poets. The poets  provided specific operational wisdom for all the contingencies  of life.</p></blockquote><p>::Tribal encyclopedia: a.k.a. Oral History -&gt; a repository of cultural memory preserved and perpetuated by an entire populace::</p><hr><blockquote><p>In order to  cope with data at electric speed in typical situations of  “information overload,” men resort to the study of  configurations…</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>“The medium is the message” means, in terms of the electronic age, that a totally new environment has been created. The “content” of this new environment is the old  mechanized environment of the industrial age.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>As our proliferating technologies have created a whole series of new environments, men have become aware of the arts as “anti-environments” or “counter-environments” that provide us with the means of perceiving the environment itself.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>We are entering the new age of education that is programmed for discovery rather than  instruction. As the means of input increase, so does the need for insight or pattern recognition.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Art as a radar environment takes on the  function of indispensable perceptual training rather than the role of a privileged diet for the elite. While the arts as radar feedback provide a dynamic and changing corporate image, their purpose may be not to enable us to change but rather to maintain an even course toward permanent goals, even amidst the most disrupting innovations.</p></blockquote><hr><hr><h1>Part I</h1><h2>Chapter 1: The Medium Is the Message</h2><blockquote><p>In a culture like ours, long accustomed to splitting and dividing all things as a means of control, it is sometimes a bit of a shock to be reminded that, in operational and practical fact, the medium is the message. This is merely to say that <strong>the personal and social consequences of any medium— that is, of any extension of ourselves — result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology.</strong></p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The electric light is pure information. It is a medium without a message, as it were, unless it is used to spell out some verbal ad or name. <strong>This fact, characteristic of all media, means that the “content” of any medium is always another medium.</strong></p></blockquote><p>::Does any technology with the potential to become a medium only become so when it is used to intentionally communicate symbolically?::</p><hr><blockquote><p>What we are considering here, however, are the psychic and social consequences of the designs or patterns as they amplify or accelerate existing processes. For the “message” of any medium or technology is the change of scale or pace or pattern that it introduces into human affairs.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>This fact [that the electric light is apparently always a medium] merely underlines that “the medium is the message” because it is the medium that shapes and controls the scale and form of human association and action.</p><p>The content or uses of such media are as diverse as they are ineffectual in shaping the form of human association. Indeed, it is only too typical that the “content” of any medium blinds us to the character of the medium.</p></blockquote><p>::Does it only <em>become</em> a medium when it is used to intentionally convey symbolic meaning? Or the moment it begins to engender change at scale?::</p><hr><blockquote><p>When IBM discovered that it was not in the business of making office equipment or business machines, but that it was in the business of processing information, then it began to navigate with clear vision.</p><p>The General Electric Company makes a considerable portion of its profits from electric light bulbs and lighting systems. It has not yet discovered that, quite as much as AT&amp;T, it is in the business of moving information.</p></blockquote><p>#pint</p><hr><blockquote><p>The electric light escapes attention as a communication medium just because it has no “content.” And this makes it an invaluable instance of how people fail to study media at all. For it is not till the electric light is used to spell out some brand name that it is noticed as a medium.</p></blockquote><p>::Once again, does it only become a medium once it is used to intentionally convey symbolic meaning? It always possesses that potential, but until that potential is realized, wouldn't it not count as a medium? I may be misunderstanding what a medium is in <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="McLuhan.html">McLuhan</a>'s eyes.::</p><blockquote><p>Then it is not the light but the “content” (or what is really another medium) that is noticed. The message of the electric light is like the message of electric power in industry, totally radical, pervasive, and decentralized. For electric light and power are separate from their uses, <strong>yet they eliminate time and space factors in human association exactly as do radio, telegraph, telephone, and TV, creating involvement in depth.</strong></p></blockquote><p>::Does <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="McLuhan.html">McLuhan</a> confound technology with media because they’re married to each other? Do I?::</p><hr><blockquote><p>The increasing awareness of the action of media, quite independently of their “content” or programming, was indicated in the annoyed and anonymous stanza:</p><p><code>In modern thought, (if not in fact)</code><br><code>Nothing is that doesn’t act,</code><br><code>So that is reckoned wisdom which</code><br><code>Describes the scratch but not the itch.</code></p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>the latest approach to media study considers not only the “content” but the medium and the cultural matrix within which the particular medium operates.</p></blockquote><p>::<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="McLuhan.html">McLuhan</a> says that Hans Selye’s <em>Stress of Life</em> theory emphasizes how the medium is socially the message, but this seems incongruent with his previous comparisons of electric power, the electric light, the railroad, and the airplane. Stress of Life is predicated upon living beings that can experience and transmit stress – the rest are mechanical technologies. Granted, those technologies can <em>also</em> experience mechanical stress, or other manifestations of stress, but they’re still not the human equivalent on a chemical level. Why am I stuck on this? They may be parallel enough to justify this comparison.::</p><blockquote><p>The older unawareness of the psychic and social effects of media can be illustrated from almost any of the conventional pronouncements:</p><p><em>“The products of modern science are not in themselves good or bad; it is the way they are used that determines their value.”</em> That is the voice of the current somnambulism.</p><p>Suppose we were to say, <em>“Apple pie is in itself neither good nor bad; it is the way it is used that determines its value.”</em></p><p>Or, <em>“The smallpox virus is in itself neither good nor bad; it is the way it is used that determines its value.”</em></p><p>Again, <em>“Firearms are in themselves neither good nor bad; it is the way they are used that determines their value.”</em></p><p>That is, if the slugs reach the right people firearms are good. If the TV tube fires the right ammunition at the right people it is good. I am not being perverse. There is simply nothing in the Sarnoff statement that will bear scrutiny, for it ignores the nature of the medium…</p></blockquote><p>::What about meta-levels and laterality?::</p><blockquote><p>That is, if the slugs reach the right people firearms are good.<br>::What if those slugs are being used to hunt game for food? What if they’re used in self-defense?::</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If the TV tube fires the right ammunition at the right people it is good.<br>::”If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” Counterpoint: Not everything that the TV tube fires is ammunition, and if it seems that way, then it’s a matter of perspective.::</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>…in the true Narcissus style of one hypnotized by the amputation and extension of his own being in a new technical form.</p></blockquote><p>::Does wanting to know more about humanity’s evolving tendency to externalize and immortalize what goes on in their minds (or at least focusing on the media produced by that behavior) constitute as Narcissistic navel gazing?::</p><hr><blockquote><p>It has never occurred to General Sarnoff that any technology could do anything but add itself on to what we already are.</p></blockquote><p>::I thought I understood this, but no, I don’t get it.::</p><hr><blockquote><p>And the paradox of mechanization is that although it is itself the cause of maximal growth and change, the principle of mechanization excludes the very possibility of growth or the understanding of change. For <strong>mechanization is achieved by fragmentation of any process and by putting the fragmented parts in a series.</strong> Yet, as David Hume showed in the eighteenth century, there is no principle of causality in a mere sequence.</p></blockquote><p>::This reminds me of Kuhn’s theory of scientific change, Normal Science vs Revolutionary Science – Godfery-Smith argued that they’re both required. Seems like the same case here, even if <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="McLuhan.html">McLuhan</a> seems to be against that idea.::</p><hr><blockquote><p>With instant speed the causes of things began to emerge to awareness again, as they had not done with things in sequence and in concatenation accordingly. Instead of asking which came first, the chicken or the egg, it suddenly seemed that a chicken was an egg’s idea for getting more eggs.</p></blockquote><p>::Hence the nervous system analogy. Yep, this part does make sense to me.::</p><hr><blockquote><p>The message of the movie medium is that of transition from linear connections to configurations.</p></blockquote><p>::What about documentaries, home movies, etc? Maybe I’m just not understanding this thoroughly enough.::</p><hr><blockquote><p>In other words, cubism, by giving the inside and outside, the top, bottom, back, and front and the rest, in two dimensions, drops the illusion of perspective in favor of instant sensory awareness of the whole.</p></blockquote><p>::It’s an infidelious warping though, like what happens when you watch those videos that try to explain higher dimensions using shadows as an example::</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>Is it not evident that the moment that the sequence yields to the simultaneous, one is in the world of the structure and of configuration?</strong></p></blockquote><p>::This is actually a really good point, though.::</p><hr><blockquote><p>Specialized segments of attention have shifted to <strong>total field</strong>…</p></blockquote><p>::a.k.a. vistas, a.k.a. big picture::</p><hr><blockquote><p>De Tocqueville, in earlier work on the French Revolution, had explained how it was the printed word that, achieving cultural saturation in the eighteenth century, had homogenized the French nation. Frenchmen were the same kind of people from north to south The typographic principles of uniformity, continuity, and linearity had overlaid the complexities of ancient feudal and oral society.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>De Tocqueville’s contrast between England and America is  clearly based on the fact of typography and of print culture creating uniformity and continuity. England, he says, has rejected this principle and clung to the dynamic or oral common-law  tradition. Hence the discontinuity and unpredictable quality of English culture.</p></blockquote><p>::What Richard refers to as levels and meta-levels, <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="McLuhan.html">McLuhan</a> broadly seems to refer to as mediums and technology interchangeably.::</p><blockquote><p>The grammar of print cannot help to construe the message of oral and non written culture and institutions.</p></blockquote><p>::Right, because entities at Level 4 and Level 5 are fundamentally incomparable – although they <strong>can be bridged/stacked</strong>::</p><blockquote><p>The English aristocracy was properly classified as barbarian by Matthew Arnold because its power and status had nothing to do with literacy or with the cultural forms of typography.</p></blockquote><p>::Right, because the aristocracy's communication behavior was lower-level::</p><hr><blockquote><p>De Tocqueville was a highly literate aristocrat who was quite able to be detached from the values and assumptions of typography. That is why he alone understood the grammar of typography.</p></blockquote><p>::Just to be clear, what <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="McLuhan.html">McLuhan</a> repeatedly refers to as typography is Level 4.::</p><blockquote><p>And it is only on those terms, standing aside from any structure or medium, that its principles and lines of force can be discerned. For any medium has the power of imposing its own assumption on the unwary (a.k.a. a Narcissus trance).</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p><em>A Passage to India</em> by E. M. Forster is a dramatic study of the inability of oral and intuitive oriental culture to meet with the rational, visual European patterns of experience.</p></blockquote><p>::Once again comparing the incomparable Level 4 vs Level 5::</p><blockquote><p>Quote from A Passage to India:<br><em>“Life went on as usual, but had no consequences, that is to say,  sounds did not echo nor thought develop. Everything seemed cut off at its root and therefore infected with illusion.”</em></p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The ultimate conflict between sight and sound, between written and oral kinds of perception and organization of existence is upon us.</p></blockquote><p>::This is why the dance of the honeybee, music videos, and interactive articles are all powerful multi-multi-dimensional tools for communication. They don’t try to compare meta-levels or levels, they integrate them into a greater whole. <strong>They’re true multi-media.</strong>::</p><hr><blockquote><p>Detribalization by literacy and its traumatic effects on tribal man…</p></blockquote><p>::Does tribalization = Level 3? Because it’s based on language at the capabilities level rather than at it is own level? (would it at its own level = resonance?)::</p><hr><blockquote><p>lines of force</p></blockquote><p>::The way <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="McLuhan.html">McLuhan</a> refers to lines of force, he’s talking about the ramifications of media on a more immediate level::</p><p>::Exploration of lines of force over space and time:::</p><pre><code>Consider the 3x3 grid:

But with electric media Western man himself experiences exactly the same inundation as the remote native.</p></blockquote><p>::This is what Richard does to people, he inundates them with concepts for which nothing has probably prepared them, to force them to disintegrate psychologically.::</p><hr><blockquote><p>Mental breakdown of varying degrees is the very common result of uprooting and inundation with new information and endless new patterns of information.</p></blockquote><p>::Considering this is what can lead to (positive) disintegration, this can be a good thing in my eyes if you think Dabrowski's work has merit.::</p><hr><blockquote><p>Ancient prehistoric societies regard violent crime as pathetic.</p></blockquote><p>::Where are the sources this? I'd really like to read more about this.::</p><hr><blockquote><p>The  American stake in literacy as a technology or uniformity applied to every level of education, government, industry, and social life is totally threatened by the electric technology.</p></blockquote><p>::So <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="McLuhan.html">McLuhan</a> regards literacy as the technology, and writing as a medium for it?::</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>Our conventional response to all media, namely that it is how they are used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot</strong></p></blockquote><p>::I disagree.::</p><hr><blockquote><p>The effects of technology do not occur at the level of opinions or concepts, but alter sense ratios or patterns of perception steadily and without any resistance.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>For the man in a literate and homogenized society ceases to be sensitive to the diverse and discontinuous life of forms.</p></blockquote><hr><p>::In some ways, the way that <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="McLuhan.html">McLuhan</a> compares the invisible and irresistible effects of media upon those who create it and consume it versus the way people expect to interact with it based upon their opinions and perceptions of it reminds me of the whole Hawthorne Principle comparison to quantum physics, even though the Hawthorne experiments were showed to pretty much be inconclusive at best.::</p><hr><blockquote><p>Print created individualism and nationalism in the sixteenth century. Program and “content” analysis offer no clues to the magic of these media or to their subliminal charge.</p></blockquote><p>::That's a bold statement.::</p><hr><blockquote><p>Subliminal and docile acceptance of media impact has made them prisons without walls for their human users.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>That our human senses, of which all media are extensions, are also fixed charges on our personal energies, and that they also configure the awareness and experience of each one of us, may be perceived in another connection mentioned by the psychologist C. G. Jung:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><code>“Every Roman was surrounded by slaves. The slave and his psychology flooded ancient Italy, and every Roman became inwardly, and of course unwittingly, a slave. Because living constantly in the atmosphere of slaves, he became infected through the unconscious with their psychology. No one can shield himself from such an influence (Contributions to Analytical Psychology, London, 1928).”</code></p></blockquote><hr><hr><h2>Chapter 2: Media Hot and Cold</h2><blockquote><p>Hot media are, therefore, low in participation, and cool media are high in  participation or completion by the audience.</p><p>Naturally, therefore, a hot medium like radio has very different effects on the user from  a cool medium like the telephone.</p></blockquote><p>::Hot media = low in participation or completion by the audience::<br>::Cool media = high in participation or completion by the audience::</p><hr><blockquote><p>A cool medium like hieroglyphic or ideogrammatic written characters has very different effects from the hot and explosive medium of the phonetic alphabet.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p><strong>The heavy and unwieldy media, such as stone, are time binders.  Used for writing, they are very cool indeed, and serve to unify the ages; whereas paper is a hot medium that serves to unify spaces horizontally, both in political and entertainment empires.</strong></p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Any hot medium allows of less participation than a cool one, as a lecture makes for less participation than a seminar, and a book for less than dialogue.</p></blockquote><p>::I’m not sure I agree with this contention, if only because seminars and books no longer come in in-person and physical formats, respectively.::</p><hr><blockquote><p>Intensity or high-definition engenders specialism and fragmentation in living as in entertainment, which explains why any intense experience must be “forgotten,” “censored,” and reduced to a very cool state before it can be “learned” or assimilated.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The Freudian “censor” is less of a moral function than an indispensable condition of learning… The “censor” protects our central system of values, as it does our physical nervous system by simply cooling off the onset of  experience a great deal.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For many people, this cooling system brings on a life-long state of psychic <em>rigor mortis,</em> or of somnambulism, particularly observable in periods of new technology.</p></blockquote><p>::(Draught of) Living Death::</p><hr><blockquote><p>Specialist technologies detribalize. The nonspecialist electric technology retribalizes.</p></blockquote><p>::Once again, harkening back to Kuhn’s theory of scientific change.::</p><hr><blockquote><p>For myth is the instant vision of a complex process that ordinarily extends over a long period. Myth is contraction or implosion of any process, and the instant speed of electricity confers the mythic dimension on ordinary industrial and social action today. We <em>live</em> mythically but continue to think fragmentarily and on single planes.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Concern with <em>effect</em> rather than <em>meaning</em> is a basic change of our  electric time, for effect involves the total situation, and not a  single level of information movement.</p></blockquote><p>::Which implies that meaning involves only a single level of information movement?::</p><hr><p>::<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="McLuhan.html">McLuhan</a> basically seems to think that regression is a good thing? But this isn't this phenomenon is cyclical?::</p><hr><blockquote><p>Whole cultures could now be programmed to keep their emotional climate stable in the same way that we have begun to know something about maintaining equilibrium in the commercial economies of the world.</p></blockquote><p>::<strong>This alone is a motivation behind what I’m doing.

Nearly all the emotional and corporate family  feeling is eliminated from his relationship with his social group. <strong>He is emotionally free to separate from the tribe and to become a civilized individual, a man of visual organization who has uniform attitudes, habits, and rights with all other civilized individuals.</strong></p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The phonetic alphabet is a unique technology. There have been many kinds of writing, pictographic and syllabic, but there is only one phonetic alphabet in which semantically  meaningless letters are used to correspond to semantically meaningless sounds.

To non-literate people, it is perfectly obvious that the most commonplace conveniences represent total changes in culture.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>For the West, literacy has long been pipes and taps and streets and assembly lines and inventories. Perhaps most potent of all as an expression of literacy is our system of uniform pricing that penetrates distant markets and speeds the turnover of commodities.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Even our ideas of cause and effect in the literate West have long been in the form of things in sequence  and succession, an idea that strikes any tribal or auditory culture as quite ridiculous, and  one that has lost its prime place in our own new physics and biology.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Their unique separation of sight and sound from semantic and verbal content made them a most radical technology for the translation and homogenization of cultures.</p><p>The phonetic letters alone could be used to translate, albeit crudely, the sounds of any language into one-and-the-same visual code.</p></blockquote><hr><p>::At this stage in my reading of this book, my biggest problem with <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="McLuhan.html">McLuhan</a>’s paradigm is that it insists on treating the East and the West as separate entities that must remain as such.

What emerges is a total field of inclusive awareness.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It is to the railroad that the American city owes its abstract grid layout, and the nonorganic separation of production, consumption, and residence.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Our electric extensions of ourselves simply by-pass  space and time, and create problems of human involvement and organization for which  there is no precedent.</p></blockquote><hr><hr><h2>Chapter Eleven: Profile of the Crowd</h2><blockquote><p>The power of sheer numbers, in wealth or in crowds, to set up a dynamic drive toward growth and aggrandizement is mysterious.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The drive toward unlimited growth inherent in any kind of crowd, heap, or horde would seem to link economic and population inflation.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>The pleasure of being among the masses is the sense of the joy in the multiplication of numbers, which has long been suspect among the literate members of Western society.</p></blockquote><p>::lol then this explains my affinity for minimalism in all its forms. But really, that’s an interesting possible correlation between introversion and minimalism::</p><hr><blockquote><p>the separation of the individual from the group in space (privacy), and in thought (“point of view”), and in work (specialism)</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Phonetic letters and numbers were the first means of fragmenting and detribalizing man.</p></blockquote><p>::then is he implying the same about symbolism and communication?::</p><hr><blockquote><p>Moholy-Nagy notes how, to Europeans, America seems to be the land of abstractions, where numbers have taken on an existence of their own in phrases like “57 Varieties,” “the 5 and 10,” or “7 Up” and “behind the 8-ball.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Perhaps this is a kind of echo of an industrial culture that depends heavily on prices, charts, and figures.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Baudelaire had the true intuition of number as a tactile hand or nervous system for interrelating separate units, when he said that “number is within the individual. Intoxication is a number.”</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Number, that is to say, is not only auditory and resonant, like the spoken word, but originates in the sense of touch, of which it is an extension. The statistical aggregation or crowding of numbers yields the current cave-drawings or finger-paintings of the statisticians’ charts.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>We need not feel grateful to apocalyptic writers like Spengler, who see our technologies as cosmic visitors from outer space. The Spenglers are tribally entranced men who crave the swoon back into collective unconsciousness and all the intoxication of number.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It is certainly an indication of a developing visual stress in a culture when number appears.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A closely integrated tribal culture will not easily yield to the separatist visual and individualistic pressures that lead to the division of labor, and then to such accelerated forms as writing and money. On the other hand, Western man, were he determined to cling to the fragmented and individualist ways that he has derived from the printed word in particular, would be well advised to scrap all his electric technology since the telegraph.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It seems contradictory that the fragmenting and divisive power of our analytic Western world should derive from an accentuation of the visual faculty. This same visual sense is, also, responsible for the habit of seeing all things as continuous and connected.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Fragmentation by means of visual stress occurs in that isolation of moment in time, or of aspect in space, that is beyond the power of touch, or hearing, or smell, or movement. By imposing unvisualizable relationships that are the result of instant speed, electric technology dethrones the visual sense and restores us to the dominion of synesthesia, and the close interinvolvement of the other senses.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>It never occurred to him that the ratio among corporeal things could never be less than rational. That is to say, rationality or consciousness is itself a ratio or proportion among the sensuous components of experience, and is not something added to such sense experience.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>Consciousness, complex and subtle, can be impaired or ended by a mere stepping-up or dimming-down of any one sense intensity, which is the procedure in hypnosis. And the intensification of one sense by a new medium can hypnotize an entire community.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>This is a striking instance of how easily men of any one particular culture will panic when some familiar pattern or landmark gets smudged or shifted because of the indirect pressure of new media.</p></blockquote><hr><p>We have already seen how the phonetic technology fostered visual continuity and individual point of view, and how these contributed to the rise of uniform Euclidean space.</p></div>
