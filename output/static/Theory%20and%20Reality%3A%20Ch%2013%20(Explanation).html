Only refers to deductive covering law explanations.</p></blockquote><h3>Problems With the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="CLToE.html">CLToE</a></h3><p>-&gt; Main problem = asymmetry problem<br>-&gt; Most famous illustration of asymmetry problem = case of the flagpole and the shadow</p><p>Explanations have a kind of directionality.<br>* Some arguments can be reversed and remain valid.<br>* But explanations can't usually be reversed in this way<br>* So not all good arguments that contain laws are good explanations.<br>* This objection (asymmetry problem) was given by Sylvain Bromberger in 1966</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="CLToE.html">CLToE</a> sees explanation as extremely similar to prediction – the only difference is what you do and don't know.<br>* Symptoms can be used to predict but not explain, yet they can be used in a good logical argument along with law to show something's expected.</p><h4>The Disease Analogy</h4><ul><li><p>If you know only that disease D produces symptom S</p></li><li><p>Then you can make inferences from S to D</p></li><li><p>In some cases you might be able to predict from D to S</p></li><li><p>But you can't explain D in terms of S because explanation only runs one way from, D to S, regardless of how many kinds of inferences can be made in the other direction</p></li><li><p>Good explanations of S can be given in terms of D even if isn't a reliable symptom of D, even if S is not always to be expected when someone has D.</p></li></ul><hr><h2>13.3 (Causation, Unification, and More)</h2><h3>Causation</h3><p>The flagpole case suggests how to build a better theory:</p><blockquote><p>To <strong>explain</strong> something is to describe what <strong>caused</strong> it<br>* a request for an explanation seems to amount to a request for information about what caused the thing in question</p></blockquote><p>-&gt; The whole idea of causation and causal connection is extremely controversial in philosophy and within the empiricist tradition. It's viewed as a suspicious metaphysical concept that should be avoided</p><p>In the 1980's, probability theory was used to supplement analyses regarding the idea that explaining something is giving information about how it was caused.</p><h4>What kind of information about causes is needed for a good explanation?</h4><ul><li><p>Imagine you have an idealized, 'complete' explanation containing everything in the causal history of the event in question, specified in total detail</p></li><li><p>People don't want the complete explanation</p></li><li><p>In any context of discussion in which a request for explanation is made, only some piece or pieces of the complete explanation will be relevant</p><ul><li><p>We're often able to know and describe these relevant pieces of a <strong>total causal structure</strong></p></li></ul></li><li><p>So to give a good explanation all you need is a description of these relevant pieces of the whole.</p></li></ul><h3>Unification</h3><p>-&gt; Was developed after the demise of the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="CLToE.html">CLToE</a> by Michael Friedman and Philip Kitcher as an alternative to a theory of unification in science that's tied to the idea of deriving phenomena from laws.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Unificationist Theory:</strong> Explanation in science is a matter of connecting a diverse set of facts by subsuming them under a set of basic patterns and principles.</p><p>We try to develop general <em>explanatory schemata (schemes)</em> that can be applied as widely as possible to reduce the number of things we must accept as fundamental.</p></blockquote><h4>Explanatory Promise</h4><p>Kitcher argued that Darwin's theory of evolution and Newton's theory of matter were compelling in their early stages despite not making many new specific predictions because they promsied to explain so much.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Explanatory promise:</strong> the ability of a theory to unify a great range of phenomena with a few general principles.</p></blockquote><p>Summary of Two Main Proposals Against <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="CLToE.html">CLToE</a></p><ol><li><p>Causal Theory</p></li><li><p>Unification Theory</p></li></ol><p>But a variety of different relations can be explanatory.</p><p>Whether they were all for absolute causality or absolute unification, philosophers have ultimately agreed that there seems to be a need for both when it comes to a theory of explanation – a pluralism.</p><h3>The Alternative View to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="CLToE.html">CLToE</a>, Causal and Unification Theories</h3><p>-&gt; Contextualism: The standards for good explanation are partially dependent on the scientific context<br>* The idea of explanation operates differently within different parts of science, and within the same part but at different times.<br>* So the standards for a god explanation in field A don't necessarily apply to field B.</p><h4>Kuhn's Contributions</h4><p>Kuhn argued something similar when he said that:</p><ul><li><p>different theories/paradigms bring with them their own standards for what counts as a good explanation.</p></li><li><p>standards about whether a relation counts as 'causal' also depend on paradigms.</p></li></ul><p>Kuhn argued that the idea of explanation will evolve as our ideas about science and about the universe change.</p><p>Scientific traditions usually have good reasons for their treatment of the idea of explanation dependent for instance on views of what the world contains.</p><h3>Use of the Word 'Explain' in Science</h3><ol><li><p>Technical sense</p><ul><li><p>e.g. mathematical measurements of 'the amount of variation explained'</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Rhetorical use</p><ul><li><p>e.g. 'your theory accommodates this result, but doesn't really explain it.'</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A low-key application in science</p><ul><li><p>e.g. describing how things work, description of mechanisms and processes</p></li></ul></li></ol><h4>Back to Van Fraassen</h4><ul><li><p>Like Van Fraassen, Godfrey-Smith denies that explanation is a single, special relation common to all of science.</p></li><li><p>Van Fraassen denied that explanation is something inside science, and denied that scientific reasoning includes the assessment of the explanatory power of theories. -&gt; explanation is something that people do when they take scientific theories and use them to answer questions external to science</p><ul><li><p>Godfrey-Smith contends that explanation is thoroughly internal to science, but variously so.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>On Explanatory Inference</h3><p>-&gt; &quot;Inference to the best explanation&quot;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Explanatory Inference:</strong> Inference from a set of data to a hypothesis about a structure or process that would explain the data.</p></blockquote><p>Suggests there's only one kind of relationship between data and hypothesis that's involved in explanatory inference.</p><p>Godfrey-Smith views explanatory inference as a matter of devising and comparing hypotheses about hidden structures that might be responsible for data.</p><hr><h2>13.4 (Laws and Causes)</h2><p>-&gt; Delving into the intersection of philosophy of science and metaphysics.</p><p>What are laws of nature? What is causation?<br>* both cases involve concepts aimed at picking out a special kind of connection between things in the world.</p><h3>Humeanism</h3><p>Recent philosophical attitudes have been to revise rather than reject these concepts.<br>* Philosophers have tried to analyze both in terms of patterns in the arrangement of things, rather than some extra connection between things -&gt; a.k.a. Humeanism</p><p>David Hume -&gt; the first philosopher to develop a really focused suspicion about concepts of connection between events in nature.</p><p>A philosopher with Humean views will construe laws of nature as no more than regularities/basic patterns in the arrangement of events. Which leads to a problem...</p><blockquote><p><strong>Law:</strong> Something that directs, guides, or governs in some way</p></blockquote><p>Laws are seen as <em>responsible</em> for the regular patterns we see, rather than being <em>identical</em> with those patterns.<br>* Humean philosophers, like Logical Empiricists, regard this 'governing' conception of laws as something to be avoided</p><h4>When Discussions of Laws and Their Role in Science Has Little Contact with Actual Scientific Work</h4><p>In 1983, Nancy Cartwright argued that what people call 'laws of physics' don't usually describe the behavior of real systems, but of highly idealized fictional systems.</p><p>Philosophers are no longer as obsessed with natural laws as the goal of scientific theorizing.</p><p>Genuine science <em>doesn't</em> have to contain hypothesized laws with ideas organized via that concept.</p></div>
